LA excluded because the jungle primaries makes the ballotpedia page a disaster

MS general elections don't report party... the party info is avalible in the primary page, but for now I'm ignoring that.

2015_urls contains the urls to the Ballotpedia pages with the 2015 state legislative results.
state_legislature_scrape_2015.py is the script that scrapes Ballotpedia, parses the results, and writes to the output file.
2015_election_results.csv is the output file, as scraped on Nov 3 2017.
